# PTS_RATP

## OBJECTIVE

With this web app, we want to facilitate the life of the users of the public transport in Paris and its suburb. We want it to be user friendly.

We want our app to:

* Display subway/bus/train/RER plans
  
* Help the user to find a stop
    
* Calculate the trajectories
  
* Calculate the duration of the journey
  
* Take in account the connections
  
* Take in account the problems on the network
  
* Display the journey, step-by-step
  
* Suggestions about the surroundings (restaurants, places to visit, etc.)
  

## WHAT WE WANT TO USE

We think about coding this solution in C# and using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
